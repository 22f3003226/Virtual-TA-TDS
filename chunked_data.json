    "content": "Hi Srividya Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server Its serverless Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints When the endpoint is triggered the appropriate function runs This renders name main part of the code unnecessary at best since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application but its not because a vercel wrapper application s or processes have started before it In other words you do not create a flask server or a http server or indeed any server at all Just functions tied to specific endpoints So you have to rethink how your application is designed You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD 1 or MAD 2 This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications Thanks for your input Kind regards",
